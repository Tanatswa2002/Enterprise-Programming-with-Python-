Encapsulation:
- Encapsulation allows proh=grammers to bndle attributes with their associated methods, this is so that only ethods a part of the same class as te attributes ca make any mdoifcations to 
data(attributes) of the class.
- Why is this importanat if programmer has access tp source code and can still modify this data?
    * Encapsulation is meant to protect code from accidental misuse, where a programmer could msiatkenly interrupt the internal data by modifying the data incorrectly 
    * It is not meant for prgrammers with access to teh cod who ish to interact with the cod maliciously
    *Establishes clear interfaces, maiantains consistency and reliability becaue users of the classes only interact with the class via associated methods
    

-Abstraction:
-Abstraction deals with what a class shpuld have however the impmeentatio of these 
fuctions are depdnet on the sub-class involved
- this si because a lot of classes could have the same blueprint however how the blueprint is 
impmeneted is dependent on the actual class.
